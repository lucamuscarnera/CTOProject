# Mathematics of the sparsification

Let $\mathscr W$ the space of possible parameters. <br>
Let $\mathcal F_f: \mathscr W \rightarrow \mathscr F$ the <b>network realizing function</b>, which is the map that
converts parameters in $\mathscr W$ into actual functions, belonging to the functional space $\mathscr F$;
$f$ here is defined as the <b>activation function</b>, namely the <b>ReLU</b> function<br>
It is easy to show that 

$$
\exists N : \mathscr W \sim \mathbb R^N
$$

given the simple argument, that our representation of parameters is fundamentally based on floating point numbers.
