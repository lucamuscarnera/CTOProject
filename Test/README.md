# Test enviroment

The following folder contains a training application for the generation of small (dense) MLP neural network.
To run it type

<code>python3 ./train.py ./params</code>

This will train a neural network, saving the weights in the folder 
<code>params</code>

Then, it is possible to launch the sparsifier running
<code> ... ./params ./params_sparse</code>

To visualize the sparsity structure of the network run
<code> ... </code>
